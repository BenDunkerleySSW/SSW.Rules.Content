The phrase ‘belt and braces’ means having two processes to achieve the same result, when one is sufficient. Although there are some occasions when it is important to have backup security measures, generally the result of a belt and braces process is time being wasted on redundant measures or securities.

### When it can be useful

Sometimes, it is important to have two methods for something. In contexts where there is a chance of failure with significant consequences, a 'belt and braces' approach is useful to ensure worst-case problems are avoided.

For example, having both encryption and  two-factor authentication for sensitive data is necessary for proper cybersecurity and to protect information. It is also always a good idea to have reserve backups of your data in case your hard drive or cloud server experiences a fault.

### When it can be harmful

In most cases however, belt and braces results in redundant or illogical measures being put in place. This means  unnecessary work and maintenance, and a false sense of security resulting in less diligence. Belt and braces also slows down decision making, even for simple tasks. 

For example, it would be redundant to have both ChatGPT and a coworker read an unimportant email, or to have many different people check a minor spelling mistake.  

Many people make a belt and braces mistake when storing their passwords 

the mistake of storing their passwords in many locations, like locally on their device or on a piece of paper. In these cases, a single password manager is a superior option to avoid security risks 


A password manager helps you avoid a ‘belt and braces’ mistake by storing your passwords in one secure location, not multiple places, like locally on your device and on a piece of paper. 
Not only is this an easy way to lose track of your passwords, it is also a big security risk.
